# Student Exam Score Prediction ðŸŽ“ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project uses the **Student Performance Factors** dataset (Kaggle) to build a
linear regression model that predicts students' exam scores based on study hours.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Data cleaning and visualization
2. Train/Test split
3. Linear regression model training
4. Prediction & visualization
5. Model evaluation (MSE, RÂ² Score)

## Results
- MSE: ~10.86
- RÂ² Score: ~0.23 (study hours alone explain ~23% of exam score variance)

## How to Run
- Open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab
- Run all cells step by step
- Upload the dataset `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`
